    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h5>Novuna</h5>
    <h6>2019</h6>
    <p>
      I joined Novuna as an apprentice and in less than 4 years I went from an
      apprentice to a Voice Engineer, which is the role that I do today.
      Throughout my time here, I have grown as a person. I have more experience
      in the work setting and good experience in IT support. I regularly use
      Incident Management software (Service Now) and my day-to-day activities
      involve incident resolution and maintaining SLAs. I provide excellent end
      user support. When interacting with users, I always make sure that I am
      careful with the jargon that I use as I understand that they may not have
      technical knowledge.
    </p>
    <h5>Mazars</h5>
    <h6>2018-2018</h6>
    <p>
      I started Mazars as an audit apprentice in the September 2018 cohort.
      Alongside the job I was studying for the ACA.In regards to the job aspect
      I settled in well. I worked in different audit teams and travelled across
      the country. (Something I had never done before) I interacted with various
      types of people. In general, this taught me what the world of work was
      like and I gained experience in a very professional and corporate setting.
