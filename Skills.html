      Currently, I only have two projects. The one you are viewing now and then
      the survey form below.

    <h3 class="Forms">
      <u><strong>Survey Form</strong></u>
    </h3>
    <div class="project">
      <img src="./Images/Skills/Survery.jpg" alt="Survey" class="Survey" />
      <div>
        <p>
          I built the following as part of the FreeCodeCamp course. Once I
          completed the survey form section I copied the code into VS Code
          Studio and I made my own changes to it. The form submits to the same
          webpage. In a real-life scenario you likely would have a server which
          the responses would be sent to for processing. Click the button below
          to view the site.
