        <p>
          Hello again. I have always had a passion for IT. My current job title
          is Voice Engineer. I work on a cloud platform day to day called Cisco
          Webex Contact Centre and my primary job is to maintain the telephone
          infrastructure. Due to my passion for IT, <br />I have always wanted
          to explore different technologies and this led me down the path of
          software.
        </p>
        <p>
          I always thought, it was cool and something interesting. At the time
          of writing this, it is September 2023 and I only started learning
          software this month. <br />The site you are viewing now is just HTML
          and CSS. I have used bootstrap too which certainly makes things
          easier. Going forward I plan to continue with my journey. I will
          continue to review HTML and CSS utilising numerous resources and the
          best way to learn is by getting hands on. I plan on completing the
          FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification as thus far, this has
          helped with my learning.

              Outside of work my hobbies include football and going to the gym.
              When it comes to playing football. I am average at best. Some
              times I can have a good game, other times I miss chances that are
              probably easier to score. <br />It’s all for fun anyway. I play
              with friends/family and it’s nice to socialize and catch up with
              others. I enjoy watching football and I believe I have a good
              understanding of the game.

              I believe that keeping fit and healthy lays the foundation to your
              success. Eating well, keeping fit makes you happy and it gives you
              natural energy which you can use for your passions and hobbies.
              <br />
              I am happy with progress I have made fitness-wise. I was around
              73kg in June 2023 and I fluctuate around 69kg now. I have toned up
              a bit in the process too.

              I like to seek knowledge in regards to my religion too. This is
              something we are encouraged to do and learning new things about it
              and key information is really beneficial.
